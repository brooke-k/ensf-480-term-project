# Things To Ask About

- "A state transition diagram for major and core classes in the system or a used case diagram (one diagram per team member)"

  - Does this mean that if we do a state transition diagram, only one is needed for the entire team? Or does it mean that regardless of us choosing to do a state transition diagram OR a use case diagram each team member needs to do one?

  - Do we need to round every possible diagram into only four (one per member) diagrams, or is it expected that we choose 4  use case diagrams (out of the 4+ possible diagrams) and only do those?
