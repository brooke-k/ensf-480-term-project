## Term project for ENSF 480, Fall 2021


## About
Term project for *Principles of Software Design,* built to demonstrate understanding and application of software design patterns in the context of a multi-layered project. This program is built to mimic a rental property management system, where landlords, renters, unregistered users, and administration can interact and fasciliate the rental of residential properties through a desktop application. Data about properties, users, and an in-app messaging system is stored and maintained in a remote database and retrieved by the desktop application at runtime, with updates being done synchronously as users interact with the system.
